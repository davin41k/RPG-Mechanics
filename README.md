# RPG-Mechanics

Created rpgs mechanics by following a course.

In this project, I created such mechanics as the combat system, the distance of the aggro creeps and their patrol. Carrying different weapons by units. Player and Units gain experience with level up. Serialization of the player's stats, equipment and dead unit bodies when switching between unity scenes. The work with the camera and cut scenes was also done.
The project is still being finalized and not ready.
